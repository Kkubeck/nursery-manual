Environmental temperature manipulation
Description:
Temperature treatment involves exposing seeds to specific temperature regimes to break dormancy. This can include constant warm temperatures, constant cold temperatures, or alternating between the two to simulate seasonal changes. Temperature treatments are often used to break physiological and morphophysiological dormancy by mimicking natural environmental conditions that trigger germination. The duration and specific temperature ranges depend on the species. (PD, MPD).

Cold Stratification
Description:
Cold stratification involves exposing seeds to a period of cold temperatures, typically between 1-5°C , to simulate winter conditions. Seeds are placed in a moist medium (such as sand or peat moss) and kept in a refrigerator or cold environment for a period ranging from a few weeks to several months, depending on the species. (PD, MPD).

Warm Stratification
Description:
Warm stratification involves exposing seeds to warm temperatures, typically between 15-25°C (59-77°F), to simulate conditions that promote embryo development in certain species. Seeds are placed in a moist medium and kept at these temperatures for a period ranging from several weeks to a few months, depending on the species. This treatment is often used before or after cold stratification, depending on the dormancy type. (PD, MPD).

Alternating Temperature Treatment
Description:
Alternating temperature treatment involves exposing seeds to fluctuating temperatures over a specific period, typically alternating between warm days and cool nights. This simulates natural temperature shifts experienced in the soil and can help break dormancy in species requiring such conditions to germinate. The duration and range of temperature fluctuations depend on the species and its dormancy requirements. (PD, MPD).
