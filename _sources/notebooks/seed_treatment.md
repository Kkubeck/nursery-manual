**Description**:  
This category includes treatments where seeds are exposed to specific temperature regimes to break dormancy. Treatments may involve constant warm or cold temperatures, or alternating between the two to simulate seasonal changes. These methods are used to break physiological and morphophysiological dormancy by mimicking natural environmental conditions. (PD, MPD).

#### **Cold Stratification**  
**Description**:  
Cold stratification simulates winter by exposing seeds to temperatures between 1-5°C for a period of several weeks to months. Seeds are kept in a moist medium like sand or peat moss. (PD, MPD).

#### **Warm Stratification**  
**Description**:  
Warm stratification involves placing seeds at 15-25°C to promote embryo development. It is used before or after cold stratification, depending on the dormancy type. (PD, MPD).

#### **Alternating Temperature Treatment**  
**Description**:  
This method alternates between warm days and cool nights to mimic natural temperature shifts. It is used for species that require fluctuating temperatures to break dormancy. (PD, MPD).


### **Seed Coat Treatments**  
**Description**:  
Seed coat treatments involve modifying the seed coat, either physically or chemically, to allow water and oxygen to penetrate and initiate germination. These methods are used to break physical dormancy (PY). Treatments are divided into two main sub-categories: **Scarification** and **Heat Treatments**.

#### **Scarification (Mechanical)**  
**Description**:  
Mechanical scarification physically damages the seed coat to enable germination. Common methods include sandpaper scratching or nicking. (PY).

- **Sandpaper Scratching**: Seeds are rubbed against sandpaper or an abrasive surface to weaken the seed coat. (PY).  
- **Nicking**: A small incision is made in the seed coat using a knife or scalpel to allow water to penetrate. (PY).

#### **Scarification (Chemical)**  
**Description**:  
Chemical scarification uses corrosive agents to break down the hard seed coat. As a result, these treatments often serve a dual purpose of both scarifying the seed and disinfecting it. (PY).

- **Acid Treatment**: Seeds are immersed in sulfuric acid to break down the tough seed coat, mimicking processes such as digestion in animals. (PY).

- **Hydrogen Peroxide (H₂O₂) Soak**: Seeds are soaked in a dilute hydrogen peroxide solution to soften the seed coat and disinfect the seeds. (PY, PD).

- **Sodium Hypochlorite (Bleach) Soak**: A bleach solution is used to soften the seed coat and disinfect the seeds. (PY).

- **Ethanol Treatment**: Seeds are soaked in ethanol to break down chemical inhibitors and disinfect the surface, sometimes softening the seed coat. (PY, PD).

#### **Heat Treatments**  
**Description**:  
Heat treatments involve exposing seeds to high temperatures to break the seed coat, often mimicking natural environmental conditions like wildfires. (PY).

- **Heat Shock**: Seeds are exposed to high temperatures (80-100°C) for a short time, mimicking the effects of wildfires in fire-adapted species. (PY).

- **Hot Water Soak**: Seeds are immersed in hot water (70-90°C) for a brief period, followed by cooling to room temperature, softening the seed coat. (PY).

- **Fire Treatment**: Seeds are exposed to direct fire or heat to break down the hard seed coat, often used for species from fire-prone ecosystems. (PY).


### **Hydropriming**  
**Description**:  
Hydropriming involves soaking seeds in water for a controlled period, allowing them to hydrate without fully germinating. After soaking, seeds are dried before planting. This process activates the seed’s metabolic processes, improving germination uniformity and helping to break physiological dormancy. (PD).

#### **Cold Water Soak**  
**Description**:  
Seeds are immersed in cold water (10-15°C) for 12 hours to several days. This method softens the seed coat and hydrates seeds, promoting germination in species with hard coats or those requiring extended moisture exposure. (PY, PD).

#### **Constant Water Drip**  
**Description**:  
Constant water drip delivers a continuous supply of water over time, maintaining moisture levels and washing away chemical inhibitors on the seed surface. This steady hydration encourages dormancy breakdown and prepares the seeds for germination. (PD, PY).

#### **Warm Water Soak**  
**Description**:  
Seeds are soaked in water at 25-40°C for several hours to a day. The warm water softens the seed coat and facilitates water absorption, promoting germination in species requiring moderate temperatures to initiate growth. (PY).


### **Osmotic Priming**  
**Description**:  
Osmotic priming involves soaking seeds in a solution with low water potential (such as polyethylene glycol or salts) to control water uptake. This method allows seeds to hydrate slowly without fully germinating, promoting metabolic activation while keeping the embryo in a dormant state. After osmotic priming, seeds are dried, and germination occurs more rapidly under favorable conditions. This treatment is useful for breaking physiological dormancy and improving germination in stressful environments. (PD).

#### **Polyethylene Glycol (PEG) Treatment**  
**Description**:  
Seeds are soaked in a PEG solution, which lowers water potential and induces controlled water stress. This helps seeds prepare for germination by regulating water uptake and promoting physiological changes. PEG treatment is often used to simulate drought conditions in research. (PD).

#### **Salt Priming**  
**Description**:  
Seeds are soaked in a solution of salts, such as potassium chloride (KCl) or sodium chloride (NaCl), to induce controlled water uptake. This triggers physiological changes that help seeds withstand stress and improves germination rates in saline or drought conditions. After priming, seeds are dried and sown. (PD).


### **Growth Regulators**  
**Description**:  
Growth regulators involve treating seeds with hormones or chemicals that influence physiological processes to promote germination. These treatments are commonly used to break physiological or morphophysiological dormancy by stimulating embryo growth or metabolic activity. (PD, MPD).

#### **Gibberellic Acid (GA3) Soak**  
**Description**:  
Seeds are soaked in a GA3 solution, a plant hormone that stimulates embryo growth and helps break physiological dormancy. The duration of soaking depends on the species and the concentration of the GA3 solution. This treatment is especially useful for species with deep dormancy. (PD, MPD).

#### **Potassium Nitrate (KNO3) Soak**  
**Description**:  
Seeds are soaked in a dilute potassium nitrate solution (typically 0.2-0.3%) for several hours to overnight. This promotes germination by stimulating metabolic activity and breaking physiological dormancy. KNO3 is particularly effective for species sensitive to nitrate levels in the soil. (PD).

#### **Smoke Primer Treatment**  
**Description**:  
Seeds are exposed to smoke or smoke-infused water, which contains chemicals like karrikins that promote germination by breaking dormancy. This treatment mimics the effects of fire in ecosystems and is particularly effective for fire-adapted species. (PD, PY).


### **Seedling Support**  
**Description**:  
Seedling support treatments are applied after seeds have germinated to promote healthy seedling growth and establishment. These treatments include nutrient amendments, microbial inoculations, and soil improvements that enhance root development, nutrient uptake, and overall vigor. They are used to ensure strong early growth once dormancy has been broken. (Used post-germination for seedling support).

#### **Mycorrhizal Inoculation**  
**Description**:  
Seeds or seedlings are treated with beneficial mycorrhizal fungi, which form symbiotic relationships with plant roots. This enhances nutrient uptake, particularly phosphorus, and promotes early seedling growth and establishment. (Used post-germination for seedling support).

#### **Bacterial Inoculation (e.g., Rhizobium)**  
**Description**:  
Beneficial bacteria, such as *Rhizobium*, are introduced to seeds or seedlings. These bacteria help fix atmospheric nitrogen and improve nutrient availability, particularly in legumes, supporting strong seedling establishment and growth. (Used post-germination for seedling support).

#### **Biochar Amendment**  
**Description**:  
Biochar, a form of charcoal, is incorporated into the soil or growing medium to improve soil structure, water retention, and nutrient availability. It creates favorable conditions for seedling growth and development. (Used post-germination for seedling support).
