## [Scalable] ALPINE POTTING MEDIA

1 Bushels of [screened x fines] – screened and measured.			1 bu

1 Bushels of Turface MVP								1 bu

.5 Bushels of Pasteurized, Screened Soil (~15%) 					0.5 bu

.75 Bushels of Granite Grit #2; pumice or mix				         0.75 bu

TOTAL 3.25 Bushel

= 0.15 cubic yard

= 0.11 m3 

ADD					WEIGHT			VOLUME

Dolomite 65 AG			98 g				85 ml (Paterson)

Gypsum				45g 				36 ml (Paterson)

Micromax 				79 g				56 ml (Paterson)

AquaGro 2000			n/a				15 ml in 1.25 liters H2O

Clean and disinfect the work surface area before mixing media. Using a shovel; mix the Fines and Turface. Spread out the pile and add wetting agent and water mixture using watering can. Fold and remix the pile. Spread out once again and add 2 liters of water evenly over the pile. Remix the pile and spread out once again. Now sprinkle the Soil and then Dolomite, Gypsum and Micromax overtop of the flattened pile. Fold and mix twice. Spread out the pile one last time, and add the Granite Grit #2/pumice, and remix 3 more times, moving the pile from side to side to make sure that no layer remains stratified and unmixed. Store the fresh media in plastic bins.

Break up bales of peat into the soil mixer. Run mixer while adding Aquagro/water mixture with watering can. Add additional water until peat is moist, but not saturated with water. Shut off mixer. Add Perlite, Turface and Soil to mixing machine, in order, shutting off the machine between each component to avoid grinding the perlite to dust. Remove 3 bins of media from the mixer and place them at the foot of the machine. With the machine running add Dolomite, Micromax (and Fertilizer if required) to the media. Run the machine while alternating removing a bin of media from the bottom of the mixing machine and adding one to the top. Mix thoroughly adding/removing bins 6 times. Store finished media in clean, dry containers.
